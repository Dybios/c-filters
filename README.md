# Implementation of various filters in C

Implementation of different types of second order filters in C.

Ensure GCC is installed along with the libmath library.

To compile the demo, use the following command:

```gcc main_app.c iir/lpf/lpf.c iir/hpf/hpf.c iir/bpf/bpf.c iir/bsf/bsf.c -o main_app -lm```

Provided ```main_app``` has been compiled to run this demo in a Linux based system.

NOTE: This is only a proof of concept as of now.
